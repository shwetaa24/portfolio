# Resume File Instructions

To add your resume to the portfolio:

1. Place your resume PDF file in this `public` folder
2. Name it exactly: `resume.pdf`
3. The resume will be accessible at `/resume.pdf` and the download buttons will work automatically

**Supported formats:**
- PDF (recommended): `resume.pdf`
- You can also use other formats, but you'll need to update the file extension in:
  - `src/components/Hero3D.tsx` (line with `href="/resume.pdf"`)
  - `src/components/Navigation.tsx` (line with `href="/resume.pdf"`)

**Note:** Make sure your resume file is optimized for web (not too large in file size) for better user experience.
